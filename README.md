##How to use:

1.  Drop an image on the window
2.  Click _Set Origin_ and drag the origin marker to wherever you want. All calculated rects will be with reference to this point.
3.  Drag across the image to select rects. After each drag, a `CGRect` representing the frame is pasted to the clipboard.
4.  Click _Set Origin_ again to choose a different origin point
5.  Click _Restart_ to choose a different image
